# APR vs Borrower Loan Characteristics
## by Kalman Heyn
 

## Dataset

> The Dataset contains information on 113,917 loans, including borrower's annual percentage rate (APR), status, borrowed amount, debt, etc. To make the dataset more accurate, variables with missing values were dropped. Outliers were also removed to make the data more reliable.
This investigation analyzes factors that influence borrower's APR and loan type.

## Summary of Findings

> Borrower's score, rating, available bank card credit and creditscore are negatively correlated to Borrower's APR. Additionally, the independent variable score has the strongest negative relationship with borrower's APR.

> With regard to letter ratings, borrowers with the lowerest rating (HR) received higher APR percentage. Borrower with high rating (AA) received lower APR percentage.

 

## Key Insights for Presentation

> First, I created a histogram plot to visualize the APR percentage distribution.  Prosper Score, a negatively correlated variable, has the strongest relationship with Borrower's APR. I also made a scatter plot and headmap to investigate the negative correlation between Prosper Score and Borrower APR. To vizualize the effect of different letter ratings on this relationship, I created multiple scatter plots. The plots showed that the lowerest borrower rating (HR) received the highest APR percentage, and borrowers with highest rating (AA) received the lowerst APR percentage.
